## Introduction

Protein target affinity prediction plays a crucial role in drug discovery and computational biology. This project aims to develop a machine learning model 
that can predict the binding affinity between proteins and target molecules. 
The model is trained on benchmark datasets of ligand SMILES, protein sequences and corresponding affinity values.

## Dataset
Three benchmark datasets were usedto train our models:

- BindingDB
- Davis
- KiBA
